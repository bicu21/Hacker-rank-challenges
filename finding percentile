# Step 1: Create an empty dictionary to store student names and their marks
student_marks = {}

# Step 2: Read the number of students
n = int(input())  # For example, if n = 3, it means we'll read 3 student records

# Step 3: Read n lines of input
for _ in range(n):
    # Input will be like: 'alpha 20 30 40'
    data = input().split()  # splits into a list like ['alpha', '20', '30', '40']

    name = data[0]  # first part is the student's name
    # The rest are marks, which need to be converted from strings to floats
    marks = list(map(float, data[1:]))

    # Store name and marks in the dictionary
    student_marks[name] = marks

# Step 4: Read the query name (whose average we need to find)
query_name = input()  # Example: 'beta'

# Step 5: Retrieve the marks list for that student from the dictionary
marks_list = student_marks.get(query_name, [])  # Returns the list or empty if not found

# Step 6: Calculate the average
# Use sum() to add all marks, and len() to count how many marks
average = sum(marks_list) / len(marks_list)

# Step 7: Print the average rounded to 2 decimal places
# We use format string to show 2 decimal places
print(f"{average:.2f}")
# sample output 3
alpha 20 30 40
beta 50 60 70
gamma 90 80 70
